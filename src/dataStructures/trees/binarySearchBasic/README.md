## Binary Search Basic
- Binary Search finds the position of a target value within a sorted array
- Time Complexity: O(log(n))
- Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to smaller scopes
- Divide and Conquer approach
- Binary Search is faster than linear search like O(n) except for small arrays
